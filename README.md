# Data collection and exploration of EV stations data for NTU GRIDLAB MSc Project  ⚡⚡⚡

This repo would be used solely for data collection and manipulation to develop rich datasets that are properly group and full of key features required to train a SOTA for predicting electricity demand of EV charging stations. 

## TODOs
- [x] Group the data by charging stations based on location
- []  Group data by month
- []  Obtain monthly weather data for each location and add to dataset (temperature, humidity, solar intensity)
- []  Obtain road network data and include in dataset
- []  TBD
